# Pennyworth
A tool that helps me with some repetitive tasks in reviewing C# assignments.

## Usage
1. Start the program
2. Drag and drop assemblies or folders containing assemblies into the window

## Known issues
- Dependencies must be available in the GAC or in the same directory as the executable
- x64 assemblies are unsupported
- Nested types are ignored
